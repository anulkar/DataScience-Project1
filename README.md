## Project Goals/Research Questions to Answer
Explore Spotify's Playlists across different Genres of music and understand various relationships and trends between Artists, Songs & their Audio Features:
1. How do various Audio Features of a Song such as it's Danceability, Energy, Liveness, etc., influence the popularity of Songs?
2. How are popular songs trending in terms of their valence, i.e. songs that sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), vs songs that sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)? Is there any correlation between the speechiness and the valence of a song?
3. Does the duration of a song affect it's position within a playlist?
4. Amongst the top 25 songs within a playlist, how much variance is there in the Audio Features?
5. Are singles more popular than albums or compilations?
6. Does the position of a song in a playlist impact it's popularity?
